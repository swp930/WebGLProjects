    Notes to Grader
    <p>
        The range for the sides slider is from 7 to 14, I didn't add lower number of sides because the cylinder looked a little distorted
        for small number of sides. Also for an odd number of sides the cylinder will look like it's missing an edge at the end but I believe
        it looks like that because that is the flat side that loops around the cylinder. For even sides however in 2D it looks normal. The range
        for the radius slider is from 0.1 to 0.5. I outputted to the console the volume of the individual cylinders and then the total volume.
        I do the same for the surface area.

        I calculated the volume by multiplying the height of the cylinder by the area of the face. I calculate the area of the polygon with the
        following formula: n*r^2*sin(q/2)cos(q/2). Each regular polygon is divided into n triangles each with an area of r^2*sin(q/2)cos(q/2)
        where r is the radius and q is 360/n.

        I calculated surface area by multiplying the height of the cylinder with one ledge of the cylinder and then I multiply that by the number of
        sides. I calculated the ledge with the following equation 2rsin(q/2). The surface area of one cylinder would then be n*height*2rsin(q/2)

        (This was kind of a hard assignment so if there are any bugs I didn't catch: Have mercy pls.)
